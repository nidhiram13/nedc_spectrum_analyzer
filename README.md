# nedc_spectrum_analyzer
This is a Python script for NEDC (Neural Engineering Data Consortium). It uses internal tools/libraries and is specific to NEDC's guidelines. 
The program extracts samples from a specific channel of an EEG (edf file) that correspond to center_time and window_dur and computes a Fourier transform.
